ViewAR has a network of cost-efficient 3D designers, experienced with the ViewAR System. We can offer reasonable rates for creating 3D models for your application with a guarantee of effects. You can request 3d models here: [My Content/Content Requests](https://developer.viewar.com/jobs/add).

## General

These requirements are a guideline on what 3D artists need to get the most out of the created models while keeping the production time to a minimum. In general, every information on a product, reference pictures or 3D models help and the more there is, the less back and forth is needed, resulting in faster and cheaper results at a higher quality.
Any document or link to the product will help the modelers to get an overview of the model.

## Model

The model is representing the body from the Object. For a good modeling process we need following:

- Construction plan/CAD Model
- Blueprints
- Every plan should have top, front and side plan.

If there are no plans available then it is also possible to make photos or sketches. For both we would need:

- Front and Back, side and top view including measurements \(at least width/height/depth, everything more is a big plus, like seat height, thickness of frame, measurments of pillows.\)
- Non-orthographic pictures of the object or 360° View if available.
- Closeups of details that are important for the object, like mechanics.

Product pictures like this are not ideal:

Resolution should be a minimum of 8MegaPixels/3264x2448

Resolution to low

In general the more reference pictures the better, but the minimum should be from front, side, back and top, best would be orthographic:

## Mechanics

Every Model that can do some tricky stuff.

- Video including the mechanic
- Photo series
- Every possible mechanic

## Textures

Textures representing the skin of a model and the requirements are:

- Resolution 8 MegaPixel / 3264x2448
- Minimum Texture size 1024x1024 depending on
  - characteristic not repeating texture
    - Texture should be huge and from a further back view

![](http://wiki.viewar.com/download/attachments/1179973/DSCN0048.JPG?version=1&modificationDate=1418125913804&api=v2)

- Small details
  - Should be separate

![](http://wiki.viewar.com/download/attachments/1179973/black.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1418125913787&api=v2)

- Regular continuing geometrical pattern
  - Texture has to be 1024x1024 or more

If no textures are available the 3D artist will look for similar patterns, adjust colours or have to completely refactor the texture.

> More information => less effort => less time => lower costs :)
