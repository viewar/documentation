The ViewAR System provides a backend with a 3D CMS and [Developer Portal](https://developer.viewar.com/site/landing) for managing applications and content.

### Supported file formats

We strongly recommend to use .fbx and .obj 3d file formats, however, the .dae and .3ds are also supported. For best results, please consider sticking to the recommened ones, though.

### 3D model types

Every registered User is assigned a User Account and storage space for 3D models. [Advanced Models](./custom_models#advanced) may be parametric, animated, composed of an assembly of other models (Scene), and incorporate pre-defined rules and options (Configurations).
