To get you started, our Team has prepared a few Sample Models. Let's play around with one of them, so that you get a grasp of how things work!

## Sample Models
In order to better understand, below you will find a shortlist of sample models prepared by our Team.

### Model types
The ViewAR System supports three distinct model types: floor, wall & ceiling. This property is defined in model data and defines the placement mode.

#### Floor models
Models standing on the floor - chairs, tables, sofas, bikes, but also trees, buildings, people.
