  Yes, however, in order to do so, purchasing a license would be necessary. There are different types of licenses available, so you can certainly find one that fits your needs. 

## 3D Models

- **How do I add a model to the application?**  
  In order to add a model to the application, you must upload it through the _Model Manager._

- **My model is not visible in the application. Why?**  
  For your model to be visible in the application, 5the following conditions must be met:
  - Model must be in the Content Tab of the target application.
  - Model must be set to _Active._
  - The category must be set to _Active._

- **Is it possible to scale my model when using the App?**
It depends on the model "Scalable" setting. It is accessible through the Model Editor.
If the toggle is ON - in AR the model will be inserted in the default scale, however, it will be possible to change its scale. Respectively, if the setting is OFF - the model's scale will be fixed.

* **How do I disable a model in an application, but still keep it on the account?**  
  In the Developer Portal, open your project (application) and navigatie to the Content tab.

- **May one model be accessed by multiple applications?**  
  Yes. A model is not assigned to particular App-ID. Instead, it is recognised by the application by its ID and/or foreign key and therefore may be easily reused.

- **How do I set alternative material options for my model?**  
  Access the model list through the _Model Manager_ and click on the _Edit_ icon of the target model. Now, you may drag a drop multiple material options to one geometry name.

  The ViewAR System supports mesh format that transfer UV layouts. You may use .fbx and .obj files.

- **In the _Material Editor_ my model is displayed as white. What do I do?**  
  If your model is displayed as white, it means that there are not material options assign. It is nothing wrong! Just choose some of existing materials or create your own and assign them to particular surfaces of your model.
