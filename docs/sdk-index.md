The ViewAR™ Augmented Reality SDK allows you to build platform-independent AR and VR apps using advanced tracking systems purely with Web Development skills. You get access to CLI and the source code of our templates. This lets you extend and customise functionalities, user flows and interfaces. Moreover, you are able to access our rendering system and almost all tracking solutions available on the market through a straightforward JavaScript API. And if you find yourself developing a brand new template other people could benefit from – we will help you wrap it up and re-sell through our platform!

- Advanced users.
- Efficient, JavaScript-based API.
- Extend the ready-to-use templates or develop your own ones.
