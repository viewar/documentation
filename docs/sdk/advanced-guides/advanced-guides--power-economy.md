3D rendering and environment tracking are very CPU/GPU-intensive processes and can drain deviceâ€™s battery rather quickly. Certain steps can be taken to significantly reduce the power consumption of the app:

1. Pause rendering whenever showing a fullscreen overlay or view

2. Activate tracking system only when needed

3. Keep the number of scene objects to a minimum
