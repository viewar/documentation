## Advanced Models
In the ViewAR System, there are several ways to add complexity to your models.

**TIP:** Understanding this setion will be easier after you make yourself familiar with the previous sections. Make sure you at least had a quick look at the [Getting Started](3d-content/3d-content--getting-started/00--3d-content--getting-started--overview.md) part :)

[Animations](3d-content/3d-content--custom-models/advanced-models/3d-content--custom-models--advanced-models--animations.md) - Add animations to models or their parts. You will be able to access them through the JavaScript API, controlling their speed, number of iterations and triggering actions.
[Configurations](3d-content/3d-content--custom-models/advanced-models/3d-content--custom-models--advanced-models--configurations.md) - Create configurations of models and/or their properties in a scene depending on pre-defined conditions (e.g. in order to enable switching between different material options for a model).
[Parametric Models](3d-content/3d-content--custom-models/advanced-models/3d-content--custom-models--advanced-models--parametric-models.md) - Enable dimensions of parts and/or whole models to be adjusted by the App User.
[Reference Models](3d-content/3d-content--custom-models/advanced-models/3d-content--custom-models--advanced-models--reference-models.md) - Split complex, heavy models into smaller part and assemble them on the go to improve the App performance.
[Snapping](3d-content/3d-content--custom-models/advanced-models/3d-content--custom-models--advanced-models--snapping.md) - Enable objects to snap together in a predefined way (e.g. in order to switch between different table tops or assemble parts of a sofa).
