### Setup

#### Prerequisites

First, make sure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) \(&gt;= v6.0.0 and &lt;= v10.0.0\) 
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) \(&gt;= v3.0.0\)
* [git](https://meet.google.com/linkredirect?authuser=0&dest=https%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fgit-osx-installer%2Ffiles%2F)

#### Install viewar-cli

Next, install the viewar-cli globally by entering the following command into your terminal:

`npm install -g viewar-cli`

\(You might need to use `sudo npm install -g viewar-cli` to have the right permissions.\)

You only need to install this tool once. When out of date, it will alert you and provide update instructions.

#### ViewAR account

Create a free ViewAR [account](https://developer.viewar.com/user/register). You will need the credentials to be able to create new apps, upload and manage 3D content and much more. You may log in directly from the terminal:

`viewar login`
