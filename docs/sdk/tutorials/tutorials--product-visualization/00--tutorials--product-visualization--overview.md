# Create an AR App using React.js

### Goal
Before we get started we briefly want to demonstrate you what you are going to build during this tutorial.

The application allows us to add a chair to the flow at any position in the room and even drag it around. Further you can select switch between various materials for the chair.

Now that you know what this tutorial is about, letâ€™s start your AR journey!
