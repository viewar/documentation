The Drone Control App is a single-page React application built with the help of the ViewAR SDK. It allows a user to control a drone's movement with two virtual joysticks displayed on the screen.

### What will you build?

The app will be streaming the image from your device's back camera, with a 3D model of a drone placed in the real-scale. You'll be able to control the drone's movement with two virtual joysticks displayed on the screen.

To check out the final effect, download the **ViewAR SDK App** (either from the App Store or Google Play Store) on an ARKit/ARCore compatible device and input the following data:

Bundle ID: **com.viewar.drone**
Version: **1**
