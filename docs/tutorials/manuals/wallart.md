### Manual

#### What you'll need

- An **iOS or Android mobile device**.  
  Make sure that it's compatible with one of the marker-less tracking systems (ARKit for iOS, ARCore for Android).  
  You may have a look at the [supported hardware](/docs/sdk/advanced_guides/hardware).
- Up-to-date version of the **ViewAR SDK App** (available from the App Store (iOS)).

#### What you'll learn to do:

- **Position a painting/photography on a wall** in Augmented Reality.
- **Take and share a screenshot** through social media/email.
- **Save/load a project.**

#### Let's get started!

##### Setup:

- For iOS (iPhone): Download the ViewAR SDK App from the App Store.
- For Android: Download the ViewAR SDK App from the Google Play Store.

##### Using the app:

Start the ViewAR SDK App. You can either use our sample demo (App ID: **wall.art.demo**, version: **100**) or your own app [created from the Template](/docs/tutorials/wallart/app_builder).

When your Wall Art App launches, choose the Live Mode. When you see the camera picture, configure the tracking following the instructions on the screen.

Now you need to define the wall surface -it can be done by placing two points in the 3D space. Place the red markers at the floor height and confirm.
When the surface gets defined, you will be able to set the exact placement of your picture.

Done!
Walk around to see your design from all sides and angles. You can still move it around, if you fell like it!

Clicking on the _three dots_ button will open an additional menu. Explore different options like taking a screenshot and sharing it, entering the shopping cart to see a summary of objects in the scene or saving the project.
